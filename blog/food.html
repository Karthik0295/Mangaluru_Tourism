            <p class="text">Probably one of the most versatile dishes to come out of south India, a good dosa is relished by people all over the country. From the popular masala dosa to the rava variation and everything in-between, dosas are universally loved. And Mangaluru has its own version of this classic dish. Neer dosa, a delicacy popular in the Tulu region, makes for a great breakfast option. Neer dosa  in Tulu literally translates to 'water dosa'. So the dish essentially derives its name from the watery consistency of the batter. Usually accompanied with coconut chutney, neer dosa also goes well with coconut milk and even sagu. </p>

            <p class="text">Mangaloreans love their spice. There are no two ways about it. And the chilli-based kori sukka hits all the right chords in this respect. Also known as kori ghassi, this Mangalorean chicken curry is creamy, spicy with an overload of the goodness of coconut. A quintessential Tuluva recipe, kori rotti is a combination of chicken curry and crispy dry wafers made using boiled rice. A sumptuous meal in itself, traditionally the rotti or the wafers were made by the women in the house, but today itâ€™s readily available at any store across the city.  </p>

            <p class="text">For the uninitiated, Mangalore buns are an Indianised version of sweet donuts. Typically a banana poori, these puffed buns are an all-day snack. Thick and flaky, they get a mild sweetness from the ripe bananas. Fermentation plays an essential role in the making of the batter and lends the soft and pliable texture to the dough. Normally served with coconut chutney and sambar, in some regions it is also accompanied with potato palya and vegetable kurma.</p>

            <p class="text">Fiery, tangy and laced with ghee, as the name clearly suggests, chicken ghee roast is iconic for all the right reasons. Health freaks out there, you might want to ditch your diet for a short while just for this one. The origins of this dish can be traced back to Kundapura, a small coastal town in Karnataka. Though the dish has nothing to do with roasting, its unique aroma can be credited to the unusual mix of dry spices. While the Chettinad version of this delicacy is also extremely popular, for us the Managalorean Bunt variation is hands down an all-time favourite.</p>
