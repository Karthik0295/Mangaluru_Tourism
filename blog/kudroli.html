                <b>History:</b>
                The Kudroli Gokarnath Temple, Mangalore, was built in the year 1912. However, the temple as seen today came into existence in 1991, when it was renovated and expanded. Since the year 1989, the temple has played a pivotal role in the celebration of the Dasara festival in Mangalore in a grand manner.
                The Kudroli Gokarnanatha Temple was originally built for Shiva in keeping with the Nath tradition that was prevalent in the region. Nath traditions were practised by a sub-sect within Hinduism, the tradition combined the tenets of Buddhism, Shaivism, and Hatha Yoga. The Nath tradition was founded by Matsyendranath.
